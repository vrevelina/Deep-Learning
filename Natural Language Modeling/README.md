# 2 Layer LSTM Natural Language Modeling on PTB (Penn Tree Bank) Dataset using PyTorch

Some files still missing to run, will be uploaded soon..

Initial template was made by Professor Laurent, Loyola Marymount University.

Opening jupyter notebook needs a GPU. V100 GPU from Google Cloud platform was used for my run, speed was tracked for every epoch, can be seen from the output in the notebook.
